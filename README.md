# STA215-Final-Project-
## **Instructions** 
To access and apply the script, open the "final_project_script.R" file, which includes the code for my findings. To access the dataset, open the "STA215_Criminal Minds Episodes.xlsx" file. 

## **Data**
The data used for the analyses was gathering all of the Criminal Minds episode, narrowing it down to episodes that contain murder in it. The question being asked was if Criminal Minds is as gruesome as many fans claim, and if those episodes depend on when it was written, who it was written by and the perpetrators motive. Each unit of analysis was one episode and a total of 30 observations were collected. The type of sampling strategy that was used was convenience sampling. 

I gathered the data by starting the show at season 1, episode 1 and analyzed the episodes by the date it comes out and also who wrote it. I would also use the characters motive as to why that crime occured in order to determine the gruesomeness of the entire episode. Finally, I would check WikiPedia for the titled writter of that specific episode. 

## **Operationalization  
The concept of the who the episode was written by relating to Criminal Minds was operatonalized by listing numerous names of people who wrote specific "murder related" episodes. There were many writters for different episodes but a few to mention were Ed Napier, Andrew Wilder, Breen Fraizer, and more. For this variable, the people who written these episodes is especially important and taken into consideration. 

The concept of the characters motive was operationalized by watching the 30 selected episodes and determining why the perpetrator did what they did. There were numerous motives for different episodes but a few to mention were Delusional, Obessession, Cult, and more. For this variable the motives were taken into consideration when being operationalized. 

The concept of level of gruesomeness in a episode was operationalized through a quantitative variable where episodes were measured based on how gruesome it is on a scale from 1-5. Least gruesome episode would fall on the lower side of this scale and vice-versa. To measure this concept, a persons discretion would be used in order to decide the level of gruesomeness.
